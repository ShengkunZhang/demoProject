		<h1>Giant Corporations Are Hoarding the World's AI Talent <strong>strong is purple</strong></h1>

		<div>

				<p>Not everyone can go out and grab thirty AI-happy astrophysicists. And if you can&#8217;t do that, the talent pool becomes very small very quickly, since these machine learning techniques are so new and so different from standard software development. Even the big players talk about the tiny talent pool: Microsoft research chief Peter Lee says the cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback.</p>
				<p>Over the past few years, other heavyweights have snapped up so many other AI startups you&#8217;ve never heard of. Twitter bought Mad Bits, Whetlab, and Magic Pony. Apple bagged Turi and Tuplejump. Salesforce acquired MetaMind and Prediction I/O. Intel acquired Nervana. And that&#8217;s just a partial list. And it&#8217;s not just software and Internet companies doing the buying. It&#8217;s also giants like Samsung and GE that are incorporating AI into physical things. As soon as startups spring up to meet the AI need, they get sucked up into the maws of the hungriest, richest corporations.</p>
				<p>&#8220;These big companies are establishing their advantage,&#8221; says Chris Nicholson, the founder of Skymind, a still-independent deep learning startup. &#8220;Technology is always a battlefield, and they&#8217;re tilting it with these acquisitions.&#8221;</p>
				<h3><mark>A</mark> Shrinking <mark>Pool</mark></h3>
				<p>Can&#8217;t she just hire ordinary coders? Not really. Building this machine learning technology is quite different from standard software engineering. It&#8217;s less about coding and more about coaxing results from vast pools of data. </p>
				<p>The irony is that Shanahan&#8217;s domestic partner happens to be Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, one of the main companies soaking up so much of the available deep learning talent. In 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch, nabbing one of the primary forces behind this technology&#8217;s recent rise: University of Toronto professor Geoff Hinton. Then it snapped up DeepMind, the company that recently shocked the AI world by building system that could crack the ancient game of Go. These acquisitions were the start of the industry&#8217;s buying spree.</p>

				<p>But it&#8217;s not just that big players like Google are buying up so much of the talent. It&#8217;s that these big players are nabbing so many startups that were trying to make AI development tools accessible to all kinds of businesses&#8212;tools that would let businesses take advantage of AI without needing as much in-house talent. Like Wise.io, Metamind aimed to provide tools that anyone could use to build machine learning services, but it has now disappeared into Salesforce. Nervana, another option, is now part of Intel. So, in a way, the world needs even more AI talent than it otherwise would&#8212;though there are signs that some of the big players will pick up the mantle of democratized AI.</p>
				<p>That potential brain drain is not a big problem for big companies like Facebook and Google and Microsoft and, yes, GE. As Immelt points out, they&#8217;re international companies that can employ researchers practically anywhere. In his post, LeCun points out that Facebook now operates an AI lab in Paris. But that dispersal of talent could add one more layer of difficulty for smaller players here in the States. If researchers flee the country and others decline to come, the pool of available talent shrinks even further, receding beyond US borders and even further into the biggest companies. </p>
				<p>For smaller companies, the hope is that some of that expertise will trickle down in the years to come.</p>
